**EV Market in China**, with Astrid Ouyang and Fanwen Zhu<br />
_Recent decades have witnessed a rising demand and production of electric vehicles as green energy substitutes to regular automobiles. It is of great interest to government policy makers to decide which industrial policy should be implemented to boost the development of this fresh industry. In this project, we collect cityâ€“month level data of EV sales and subsidy for 15 cities in China from 2016 to 2019. Utilizing panel regression with IVs, we demonstrate that a 10,000 Yuan ($1,600) increase in purchase subsidy would boost regional EV sales by around 6% to 11%. Various regression setups corroborate the robustness of our estimation._
