The following is a list of my current projects:

* **[Research Proposal: Transaction of Knowledge under Asymmetric Information](https://uchicago.box.com/s/0dxd9tfwdsyylgebi6ek5tcpk2a9cdta)**<br />
_Companies increasingly purchase scientific-driven innovations from outside sources. While university-based inventors often struggled to locate an application scenario for their inventions, seasoned entrepreneurs backed with years of prior industrial practices often discern the unmet needs from a specific industry sector. This asymmetric information regarding the application scenarios can lead in two directions. One is that the entrepreneurs seek tight collaborations with industrial players; the other is that entrepreneurs sell their ideas too early or too soon. This research tries to identify under what situations inventors tend to sell rather than keep the company, given the asymmetric information regarding the patentâ€™s value between the incumbents and inventors._<br /><br />
* **[EV Market in China](https://uchicago.box.com/s/nwb7urih84366r5ej1vz0kw4wo27n8ku)**, with Astrid Ouyang and Fanwen Zhu<br />
_Recent decades have witnessed a rising demand and production of electric vehicles as green energy substitutes to regular automobiles. Many governments have provided incentives for consumers to purchase EVs. It is of great interest to government policy makers to know the effectiveness of this policy. In this project, we collect city-month level data of EV sales and subsidy for 15 cities in China from 2016 to 2019. Utilizing panel regression with IVs, we demonstrate that a 10,000 Yuan ($1,600) decrease in purchase subsidy would abate regional EV sales by around 6% to 11%._
